# Calendar-Application

Project Description -
Calendar Application meant to help with organization! This will display the current time to the user on the webpage as well as feaure time blocks that show past, current, and future time logs. Along with these time blocks it allows for a text entry field for the user to place an event so they can better organize their schedule. 
The technologies that were used in this project were HTML, CSS, BootStrap, & Javascript. 
The reason these technologies were used is because we use HTML as the structure of our webpage, the CSS to style it, Bootstrap to assist with more dynamic HTML & Css Elements, and finally Javascript to make our website responsive.
Some of the challenges I faced in this activity was being more comfortable with Javascript. I plan on coming back to this assignment and adding more Javascript features so it will be more responsive.
